abstract = "This paper describes our system (Solomon) details and results of participation in the SemEval 2020 Task 11 ”Detection of Propaganda Techniques in News Articles”. We participated in Task ”Technique Classification” (TC) which is a multi-class classification task. To address the TC task, we used RoBERTa based transformer architecture for fine-tuning on the propaganda dataset. The predictions of RoBERTa were further fine-tuned by class-dependent-minority-class classifiers. A special classifier, which employs dynamically adapted Least Common Sub-sequence algorithm, is used to adapt to the intricacies of repetition class. Compared to the other participating systems,our submission is ranked 4th on the leaderboard."

We participate in both subtasks: Span Identification (SI) and Technique Classification (TC). We use a bi-LSTM architecture in the SI subtask and train a complex ensemble model for the TC subtask. Our architectures are built using embeddings from BERT in combination with additional lexical features and extensive label post-processing. Our systems achieve a rank of 8 out of 36 teams in the SI subtask (F1-score: 43.86\%) and 8 out of 31 teams in the TC subtask (F1-score: 57.37\%).",

In the first task, systems are asked to identify specific text spans in a free text where propaganda is being applied. In the second task, systems are asked to identify the propaganda technique being applied in a text span. We describe the construction of the evaluation framework (dataset and evaluation metrics) as well as the approaches explored by the different participants. ",
